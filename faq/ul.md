# Uploading Worlds

## OVERVIEW

Uploading worlds is useful for when you want to upload a previous save, or upload a cool adventure map!

## METHOD 1 - INGAME

{% endhint %}

You must upload your world to an online media site, for example file.io, mediafire, or dropbox. Once you have a link to your world, run the command `/ul world <name> <link>`. This will create a world with the prefix "ul\_". To get the link you use in the command, you can use a file uploading site such as dropbox. Or any site that gives you a direct link to the download. With dropbox, after you upload the zip file to the site, get the sharable link of the thing you just uploaded. And at the end of the link, change "dl=0" to "dl=1" then use it in the command.

## METHOD 2 - WEB MANAGER

Go to the **World** section of the Web Manager. Then click `Select a zip file` under the **Upload World** section. Now select the file you want to upload, click **Upload**, and restart your server \(click the Restart button at the very top of the Web Manager\).
