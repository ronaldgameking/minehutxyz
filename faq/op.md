# Server Operator

## OVERVIEW

Being a server operator allows you to run most of the general commands the server has, including the dangerous ones.
Only give operator to people you trust!

## HOW TO OP YOURSELF

Type `/op (your username)` into the **Server Command** area of the panel. This will op you. *[Note: if you're plying on bedrock you must add an `*` before your username].*

## HOW TO OP A USER

```
JAVA: /op (username)
BEDROCK: /op *(username)
```
